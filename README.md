Beyond coding, I am all about **lifelong learning** and **mindful living**. I enjoy diving into new ideas and tech, always striving to expand my skill set and understanding of the world.

*Currently working on a couple of fun side projects:*

- **[Diabeetus](https://github.com/JamesHusband/Diabeetus)** - An AI App to help my Dad's Diabetes regime.
- **[The Curious Code Monkey](https://github.com/JamesHusband/TheCuriousCodeMonkey)** - My blog-in-progress, where I share insights on coding and beyond!
- **[Ant Keeper](https://github.com/JamesHusband/Ant-Keeper)** - Cordyceps and Ants = Game.


Here to leverage the latest in web tech to solve real-world problems and create something truly **awesome**. Let us build something amazing together! 🌍🚀

I'm currently experimenting with the **Pomodoro Technique** and **Getting Things Done (GTD)** method to manage multiple interests and stay productive!
